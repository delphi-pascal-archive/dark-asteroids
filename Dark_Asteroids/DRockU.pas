 *********************************************************************************************
 **  There are a number of people in the Delphi community pushing the idea that Delphi is   **
 **  a great platform for making games.  I wholeheartedly agree with this idea.  I've       **
 **  programmed in C for a number of years, but I've found that not only can Delphi do      **
 **  everything that C can, but it can things done in less time.  What used to take months  **
 **  to do in C, I can do in 2 weeks with Delphi.  Games are no exception.  DirectX is      **
 **  becoming the defacto standard in game development, and Delphi has full access to this  **
 **  API.  Although this program does not use DirectX, it demonstrates that you can make    **
 **  a game with a large number of sprites moving about the screen using only high level    **
 **  Object Pascal and Windows API functions and still get a good frame rate.  I hope that  **
 **  sometime in the near future some entrepreneurial company will take the plunge and use  **
 **  Delphi as the development platform for a best selling game.  Delphi could kick more    **
 **  titles out in a year than a comparable team using C, it's just a matter of time        **
 **  before somebody realizes that fact.                                                    **
 **                                                                                         **
 **  Take this game and improve it.  I want to see Delphi become the game programming       **
 **  platform of choice for Windows games.  If enthusiastic Delphi programmers keep showing **
 **  the C world that Delphi is a great games development platform, changes could happen.   **

 **  Thanks to all of those programmers who generously provide free examples to      	    **
 **  those of us still learning.  In carrying on such a tradition, this program is hereby   **
 **  designated as freeware, in the hopes that I will contribute to someone's knowledge     **
 **  base, and see Delphi being used in a much broader arena.                               **

 **  Addendum                                                                               **
 **  In the first release of this program, some users experienced a problem with the        **
 **  ProcessUserInput function if they modified the code.  The values from the              **
 **  GetAsyncKeyState API functions (a SHORT) was being compared to 0, and if the value     **
 **  was greater, the appropriate action was performed.  On some machines, the return value **
 **  was a negative number, and thus this comparision failed.  These values are now being   **
 **  compared to the hex number $8000, which seems to fix the problem.  I haven't quite     **
 **  tracked down why the original code works on some machines, but not others.             **
 **                                                                                         **
 **  Some readers have asked if this program was tested under Delphi 1.  It was written     **
 **  specifically for Delphi 2, and has not been compiled under Delphi 1.  However,         **
 **  someone pointed out to me that the only thing that needs to be changed for it to work  **
 **  in the 16 bit world is where the value of the IntersectRect API function is being      **
 **  checked.  Under Windows 95, this returns a boolean value, but under Windows 3.1,       **
 **  it returns an integer value.  I have not tested this yet, but this should help anyone  **
 **  who wants to port this application to Delphi 1.                                        **
